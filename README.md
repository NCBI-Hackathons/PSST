# PSST
Polygenic SNP Search Tool

## Overview

Here is what this pipeline does: We are developing a software pipeline to identify multiple SNPs that are associated with diseases; including SNPs that modify the penetrance of other SNPs. We are looking to identify asserted pathogenic SNPs, and Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) identified SNPs, crossed with database and datasets such as ClinVar, SRA, and GEO, and then build a pipeline for multiple genetic variants associated with diseases.


## Usage

Find SNP IDs for diseases, and then run modules.

## Module 1

This software generates SNP sequences from the SNP IDs for a disease, and then you can make blastdb.  It fits into the general scheme of this pipeline <here>.
