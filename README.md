# PSST
Polygenic SNP Search Tool

## Overview

Here is what this pipeline does: We are developing a software pipeline to identify multiple SNPs that are associated with diseases; including SNPs that modify the penetrance of other SNPs. We are looking to identify asserted pathogenic SNPs, and Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) identified SNPs crossed with database and datasets such as ClinVar, SRA, and GEO, and then build a pipeline for multiple genetic variants associated with diseases.


## Usage

<Find entries for disease, then run modules>
